Together with other national XR groups worldwide, we stand in solidarity with all those groups that have been fighting to protect their environment for many years despite threats from corporations and the government.
We will use 24-30 Stand Up Paddles (SUP) to form an XR sign and make a drone picture.

When: Meeting point 13.00 p.m. Swimming area for the horses between Salavaux and Camping Avenches
Formation; between 14.00-15.00
Info about XR: from 16.00 o'clock on
