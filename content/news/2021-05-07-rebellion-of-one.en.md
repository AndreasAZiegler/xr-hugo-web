## Don’t be a by-stander!


**The government is letting our last chance for a sustainable future slip away. We cannot accept this. We cannot continue to stand by and watch. Turning their fears into courage, dozens of people say stop in a peaceful act of rebellion - the Rebellion of one.**

Rebellion of one is an innovative form of action fit for Corona times. Individuals express their emotions and fears in the face of the climate and ecological emergencies, and take to the streets with a self-made poster. They sit alone, in front of vehicles weighing tons. Accompanied only by a small incognito support team, to ensure everyone’s physical and psychological safety. The brave person stays on the road until they are either moved, or decide to move themselves.
