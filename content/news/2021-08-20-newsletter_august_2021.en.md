## **If not you, who? Join the rebellion against Extinction**

Dear worried citizens,

The IPCC, the UN, the Federal Office of the Environment… All tell us that if we do not act immediately, there will be global food shortages, mass starvation and social collapse across the world – including Switzerland. Carbon emissions must be massively cut.\
Yet the government keeps acting like everything is going just fine. 

We demand they tell the truth. We demand they act now. And we demand a democracy fit to deal with this crisis, using Citizens’ Assemblies to get us out of the deadlock. This is a total emergency.

If the Federal Council has not responded to these simple vital demands by the end of September, we call upon every principled and peaceful citizen to rise with us.\
From October 3rd: Each day, hundreds of people, young and old, will sit down in the roads of central Zurich until action on the crisis is taken.

JOIN US.

And: Don’t come alone! Bring your friends and family - to change everything, we need everyone!
