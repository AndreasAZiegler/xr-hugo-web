## **If not you, who? Join the rebellion against Extinction**

![](/media/newsletter_picture_en.jpeg)

**Read the newsletter** auf Deutsch | en Français | in Italiano

Dear worried citizens,

The IPCC, the UN, the Federal Office of the Environment… All tell us that if we do not act immediately, there will be global food shortages, mass starvation and social collapse across the world – including Switzerland. Carbon emissions must be massively cut.\
Yet the government keeps acting like everything is going just fine. 

We demand they tell the truth. We demand they act now. And we demand a democracy fit to deal with this crisis, using Citizens’ Assemblies to get us out of the deadlock. This is a total emergency.

If the Federal Council has not responded to these simple vital demands by the end of September, we call upon every principled and peaceful citizen to rise with us.\
From October 3rd: Each day, hundreds of people, young and old, will sit down in the roads of central Zurich until action on the crisis is taken.

JOIN US.

And: Don’t come alone! Bring your friends and family - to change everything, we need everyone!

**Do it like Sonja and stick the truth under their nose!**

On August 11, mother and medical doctor Sonja Hediger came from Vaud to plaster the new IPCC report on the Federal palace. She was interrupted by the police after 7 pages, but not fined. She was joined last week by even more worried citizens.
