We are afraid of the violence that climate chaos and ecosystem breakdown will bring to humanity and our communities. To avoid that, the rebellion aims at bringing people together and establishing citizens assemblies - one way of decreasing the likelihood of civil wars. In that logic, the rebellion is strictly nonviolent and will always remain so. Moreover, treating our opponents with respect is also a tactical choice, as it increases the likelihood of their defecting. By causing disruption in a peaceful way, we present the government with a dilemma. Letting us carry on will encourage others to join. Repressing us will undermine their own legitimacy, and drive more people onto the street. Our strategy is based on classical nonviolence and the tactics that led so many people around the world to historical victories, in struggles as different as decolonisation (Gandhi...), ending racial segregation (Freedom Riders, Martin Luther King...), toppling of dictatorships (Otpor! in Serbia...), getting governments to act on the AIDS pandemic (ACT UP!), or, in our own Switzerland, ending compulsory military service (conscientious objectors).
