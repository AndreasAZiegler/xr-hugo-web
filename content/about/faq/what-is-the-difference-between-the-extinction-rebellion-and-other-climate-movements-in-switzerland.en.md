These are two different strategies. The Rebellion’s strategy is based on momentum-driven organising: in a game of social dominos, we aim to be the initial push that sets society in motion, driving it to a social tipping point beyond which deep political change is inevitable. Our main goal is therefore to target the public to bring them to take sides on the climate and ecological crisis. Our job is then to maximize the chances that they join the side that fights against extinction. It’s also the reason why we always stick to a minimal set of 3 broad demands, which happen to speak to a lot of people. 

In contrast, movements like Collective Climate Justice or Climate Strike, through their actions, often directly target the different pillars of power such as politicians, the media, or the economic world (ie. finance sector). Actions mainly happen away from the public space, and are led by closed groups of activists.
