The level of disruption achieved by an action is quite independent from the number of people involved. 100’000 on a legal march do not disrupt anything, one person sitting alone on a highway does. Rest assured that our rebellious crews are capable of causing just as much good-natured mess as they think is necessary to reach their goals ;) However, disruption is only a means to an end - we will not win unless we create a whirlwind in society, inspiring large numbers of people to join this fight for their lives, overwhelming the system. This is where numbers come into play: the more people we are at the start of the rebellion, the more people we are likely to inspire and attract over the next few days, building momentum and becoming truly unstoppable. One person sitting on a road is very moving and has the power to inspire others to find their courage. Our strategy is based on [momentum-driven organising](https://by2020weriseup.net/assets/presentations/Presentation-momentum-driven-organising-EN.pdf): in a game of social dominos, we aim to be the initial push that sets society in motion, driving it to a social tipping point beyond which deep political change is inevitable. Come join us, add your weight, and together we’ll be unstoppable!
