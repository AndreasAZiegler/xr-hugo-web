We do not glorify rebels who get arrested over those who do not choose to put themselves into that role. We work on having a regenerative culture of gratitude that values every contribution to the movement, especially since many rebels in various roles sacrifice a lot to it. For every arrested person, there are about 10 rebels who worked hard to make it possible! However, if mass arrest has been chosen as a strategy, then arrests need to be celebrated and made ‘cool’ in order for the strategy to be sustainable for the rebels themselves and for the movement (e.g. Serbian movement Otpor! that toppled Milosevic gave a special T-shirt to people having been arrested 10 times). Actually, the nastier the arrests, the more prepared the rebels must be, and the more empowering the experience must be before, and after, the time in custody. Being arrested is not a light matter, and we make it clear by preparing our rebels well with legal and psychological tips during our Non-Violent Direct Action trainings. However, it’s also a tactical choice to make it fun when arrests happen, by cheering and clapping, to enhearten the rebels, unsettle the police, and ultimately encourage more people to disobey.
