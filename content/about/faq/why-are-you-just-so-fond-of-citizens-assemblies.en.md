The rebels don’t want power for themselves. They don’t want to impose specific policies on others. They want the whole society to decide in the quickest, most democratic way possible, how to conduct emergency decarbonization and steer humanity away from extinction. The third demand of the Extinction Rebellion is that governments (at the local, cantonal, federal and international levels) create and be guided by citizens' assemblies on climate and ecological justice. Social studies have shown in the past that this is an effective way to break political deadlocks, like the one we are currently in. It allows ordinary citizens, representative of the population in its diversity, to have a real influence on the decisions related to the exit of the ecological and climate breakdown. Studies have shown also that those mini-publics usually come up with more creative and bold proposals than politicians do. Last but not least, when following a strict set of rules, they increase the likelihood that proposed measures take social justice into account, and get accepted by the broader population. It brings people together, healing fractured societies, by making sure everyone gets to meet and hear everyone else (city - countryside, young - old, left-leaning - right-leaning - apolitical).
