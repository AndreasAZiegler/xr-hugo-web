We admire the hard work by people and organisations trying to put together coherent policy proposals and do think they are absolutely necessary as a force of proposition to our society. But the rebellion fills a different strategic niche in the ecosystem of movement: our main goal is to target the public to bring them to sympathize, change their minds, and rebel. To allow maximal participation, we had to align behind a minimal set of 3 demands: to tell the truth, act now, and establish Citizens’ Assemblies on climate and ecological justice. They seem to us eminently respectable and legitimate as human beings. We reach out of our social bubbles and meet people where they are, independently from their personal views on specific policies. As a self-selected group of people, rebels have no legitimacy imposing policies on anyone - however, we demand that citizens assemblies, representative of the people of this country in their diversity, get to decide the best path forward.
