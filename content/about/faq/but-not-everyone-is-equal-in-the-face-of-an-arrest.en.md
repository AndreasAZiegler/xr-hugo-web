Some people have criticized the rebellion for its use of mass arrests, on the grounds that not everyone is equal in the face of an arrest. It is absolutely correct that some people will risk worse consequences than others, for instance if they have a precarious situation, no papers, or are more likely to be subject to police violence. It is our belief that privilege comes with responsibility to use it for the greater good, and that those who can break the law at the lowest cost to themselves have a duty be the first ones to do it. This means us in the West, and the most privileged of us within the West. However, it would be victimizing and disempowering to imply that those of us who have more to lose are unlikely to be brave enough to decide to risk it, for what is no less than the defense of everyoneâ€™s life on this planet.

What is critical is that everyone makes fully informed decisions about their part in the rebellion. The rebellion does its best at all times to ensure that no-one is accidentally arrested without being prepared and willing, and that people are supported before, during and after arrest.
