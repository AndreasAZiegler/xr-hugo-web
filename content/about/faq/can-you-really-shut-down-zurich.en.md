We focus on what is necessary. Nothing else has worked and weâ€™re racing towards extinction faster than ever before. So if this is what it takes, we are going to peacefully sit on the road in the largest city of the country, causing mass disruption, and refuse to move for as long as it takes for the government to stop ignoring our basic, perfectly sane demands, or for all of our arrestable rebels to be in custody. Nothing else will do when you are threatened with the collapse of your civilization and the loss of everything you hold dear.
