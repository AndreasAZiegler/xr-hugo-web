What we do is constitutional, legitimate and proportionate in face of the climate catastrophe we’re now entering. Based on our 4th principle, we are an open movement and consider that openness and transparency is what allows the growth of a mass movement. Our actions are not covert and we act in full public light and we accept the consequences of our acts. In case of individual repression, we will organize the support, massively publicize and not complain about it but show our determination and fearlessness.
