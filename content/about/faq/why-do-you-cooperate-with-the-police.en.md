We take a no blaming and shaming approach to the police and from our nonviolent discipline we agree to treat the police with respect. We are willing to be arrested as part of our truth-telling strategy: as far as our campaign is concerned, the police are playing their role, we are playing ours. In Switzerland, we made the decision, for the rebellion in October 2021, to liaise with the police early and openly communicate about our plans. This increases safety to all involved and creates interesting dilemma for the police which we can exploit. This is for specific countries to figure out, taking into consideration their own circumstances and the potential strategic opportunities that have been described.
