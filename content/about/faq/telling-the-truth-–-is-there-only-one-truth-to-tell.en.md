The main truth we want to get out to the world is that climate breakdown and ecological collapse are universal threats. We also recognize that we are not all equal in facing these threats, nor do we all bear the same moral responsibility. Recognizing this is the key to global justice and a future for all. Yet, it is often when they realize they are protecting what is dearest to them personally that people become ready to make sacrifices, and rebel. Collectively, we must therefore make space for every form of grief, rage and worry. We connect in empathy, without establishing a hierarchy of suffering. We come as we are and meet people where they are. The reasons to join the rebellion are as numerous and diverse as the population of Switzerland. We speak from our own experiences, and together, we embody a multi-faceted truth, made of a myriad of lived realities.
