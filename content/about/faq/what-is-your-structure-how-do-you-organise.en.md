We are a decentralised organisation – anyone can take action as part of the extinction rebellion if they pursue our common demands while following our principles and values – people don’t need anyone’s permission on that basis. Large groups of rebels work together using  self-organising systems, which is the case of XR-CH. Power is invested in roles through the use of mandates rather than held by people, and people are autonomous in fulfilling the purpose of the roles they energize. It is a creative system that grows in response to the organisation's needs. Extinction Rebellion Switzerland organise in circles focussed on Action and Strategy, Outreach and Mass mobilisation, Media and Messaging, Finance and Fundraising, Regenerative Culture, Self-Organising Systems, Liaison with German-speaking and italian-speaking part of Switzerland, and Legal affairs. An overall anchor circle meets to improve information flow between teams and resolve organisational issues that lack clarity. An overview is to be found on [holaspirit](https://app.holaspirit.com/public/extinction-rebellion-ch#u0LPpo-xr-ch-anchor-circle).
