Unlike many big profits, foundations and so-called climate communicators, we choose to be blunt about the scale of the problem. Fear is a normal and healthy reaction to the truth, and we do not try to protect people from it. Here are the reasons: first, with the truth, we give people the opportunity to face the facts and their feelings, and move forward productively. Without the truth, we deny them this chance. Second, while it is accurate that climate truth overwhelms some people, it helps others to feel the urgency and enter emergency mode as rebels. Some people might be “turned off” by climate truth temporarily, but will process it over time and then enter emergency mode later. To avoid being paralyzed by fear and helplessness, we do not only use fear, we also provide pathways to action, and empower people to fight for what they hold dear. We must remind people that social movements like the rebellion we’re planning can cause immense, rapid change. Of course it’s difficult. Of course people will feel afraid, angry, and grief-stricken. We encourage people to acknowledge these feelings and learn to see them as a call to action. The power of this truth-telling strategy has been proved by the explosive mobilisation achieved by the rebellion around the world through its standard conference, “Heading for extinction, and what to do about it?”
