Switzerland plans to reduce its net carbon emissions to zero by 2050, thus meeting the internationally agreed target of limiting global warming to a maximum of 1.5°C when compared with the pre-industrial era. Beside the fact that this deadline is far too late in order to ensure a safe and sound future for us all (see Question: “[Why 2025?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19mTUpXDpn8b07Kx4Ky1DNWY09Javc8yyM2VIKiZhm2g/edit#heading=h.7rdbgdbdp1pt)”), Switzerland still has no concrete plan whatsoever on how it wants to implement and achieve the net zero goal of 2050. Not really reassuring, right?
