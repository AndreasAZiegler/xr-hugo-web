Political power might be in Bern, but Zurich is simply where the most people live. First, large-scale disruptions in the largest city in Switzerland cannot possibly be ignored by the government, i.e. who we address our demands to. Second, this is where the rebellion will impact the most people, and the people are who we are addressing rallying cries to. We do not take pleasure in causing perturbations in peopleâ€™s daily lives, but we recognize the power of disruption to spark conversations, make people take a step back, and question their previously-held assumptions about the reality around them. When the theater is on fire, it is necessary to disrupt the play to sound the alarm.
