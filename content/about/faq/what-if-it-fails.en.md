A saying goes: “Once a nonviolent civil disobedience action is in place, it has already won”. This is because of the "dilemma" nature of this type of action for the authorities. If the authorities let it happen, they lose face and new people join the action and increase the scale of the disruption. If the authorities repress the action, they allow the protestors to demonstrate the strength of their determination and fearlessness, earning respect by maintaining nonviolent discipline, and facing the consequences. This raises the importance of the issue in the public debate, and brings new people into the fight. This classic strategy of non-violence has had great success in many different contexts in history. In case our three demands are not met after the rebellion in October, the challenge will be more about  making the absolute most of the momentum we’ve built, so victory comes quickly afterwards, because time is running out to turn things around! Finally, it may be cheesy but it’s true: doing what is right can never be a failure. And with our governments steering humanity towards mass death and suffering, rebelling has never been more right.
