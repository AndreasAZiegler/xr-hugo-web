The Rebellion’s goal and strategy is to tell the truth. We are here to communicate on what is necessary (as per our first principle), not to try and second guess what is politically feasible or not. Based on that logic, our demand could have been ‘carbon neutrality by 1975’, but this becomes physically impossible, not only politically impossible. The next best thing is 2025. A scientific justification, explanation of carbon budgets etc., can be found [here](https://www.scientistsforxr.earth/why2025).
