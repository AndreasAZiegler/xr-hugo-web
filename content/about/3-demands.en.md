### REBEL FOR <span class="green-fucxed">LIFE</span>

We are facing an unprecedented global emergency. Scientists are alerting us to the fact that we are about to fail to halt climate change and biodiversity loss before the point of no return, which once passed will inevitably lead to a de facto inhabitable planet.

So far our governments are failing spectacularly to protect us. To survive, it’s going to take everything we’ve got. We are therefore calling on you to join our mass mobilization to rebel against the destruction of our livelihood.


### OUR DEMANDS:

1. The Government must tell the truth about how deadly our situation is, declare a climate and biodiversity emergency, it must reverse all policies not in alignment with that position and must work alongside the media to communicate the urgency for change including what individuals and communities need to do.

2. Greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors are reduced to net zero by 2025 and ecological overshoot is reversed through a massive emergency mobilization. The new goals of society must be to rapidly restore a safer, cooler climate and to provide maximum protection for all people and species, especially the most vulnerable.

3. Local, cantonal, national and international citizens‘ assemblies based upon more robust forms of participatory democracy\* are created to work out how the above two aims will be brought about in their particular contexts, prioritizing the needs of people and species most affected by the ecological crisis, and to ensure that the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) is followed. [More information]({{< ref "/about/citizens-assemblies" >}}).

_*One example of this is ​Sortition​. Sortition means that participants of the assemblies are selected randomly so that they reflect the diversity of ordinary members of society and cannot be interfered with by anti-democratic forces as is the case in elections._
