_**Note:** We've experienced large numbers of people registering for this workshop and not turning up. This prevents others from registering and attending because the workshop is sold out. So we ask you to only book if you can attend and cancel your ticket in good time if you find you can't make it._

We are members of XR looking at how movements can be divided when oppression goes unaddressed, offering practical tools to heal these divisions which affect our relationships as activists.

This workshop will address the importance of understanding the structural nature of oppressions (such as racism, sexism, classism, ableism, the oppression of young people, ...), as well as doing personal healing work – both of which are necessary if we are to work together effectively in a united movement.

Please arrive from 15 minutes before the start time for a prompt start.

When you register, a Zoom link will be sent in your order confirmation email. Please check your junk mail folder in case your email ends up in there.

## Practicalities
This workshop is interactive so it's useful if each participant can join the call on a separate device.

Because we will be breaking out into smaller groups for timed 'listening exchanges' it will be very helpful if you can bring a timer to the workshop, e.g. you can use the timer app on a mobile phone (use a spare mobile if you are using your mobile for the Zoom call).

When you're in the Zoom meeting it is useful to choose "Gallery View" so that you can see everyone's lovely faces (this doesn't work on mobile phones).

## Accessibility
* This workshop is in English. We are looking to train people who can facilitate in other languages.
* We do not have sign language interpretation but you're welcome to bring your own – please can you let us know by email ahead of time so we can help them prepare before the workshop (ombraworkshop@gmail.com).
* If you have any accessibility needs please contact us on ombraworkshop@gmail.com to tell us about them and we will try to accommodate you.
